## üìñ About The Project

I built this QR Code Generator as a fun, fast-paced project to put my React skills into practice. I wanted to go beyond a basic generator and create a feature-rich tool that was both powerful and enjoyable to use. 

This was a fantastic opportunity to dive deeper into handling user interactions in React, from real-time updates as you type, to managing file uploads for the custom logo feature. Figuring out the logic to render the customized QR code onto a canvas for a perfect PNG download was a particularly rewarding challenge. The result is a clean, fully-featured, and interactive tool that I had a blast building.

## ‚ú® Features

This application is packed with features that make it a powerful and flexible tool:

* **‚ö° Real-time Generation:** The QR code updates instantly as you type.
* **üé® Full Customization:**
    * **Size:** Adjust the QR code's size with a dynamic slider.
    * **Colors:** Choose custom foreground and background colors using native color pickers.
    * **Error Correction:** Select from four levels of error correction (L, M, Q, H).
* **üñºÔ∏è Custom Logo Upload:** Upload a PNG logo to be embedded in the center of the QR code.
    * **Smart Error Correction:** Automatically switches to 'High' error correction when a logo is added to ensure scannability.
* **üì• Download as PNG:** A robust download function that correctly renders the customized QR code with its logo onto a canvas and saves it as a high-quality PNG file.
